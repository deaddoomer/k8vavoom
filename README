k8vavoom is the fork of the excellent DooM sourceport Vavoom. It features
two unique lightning systems, one based on lightmaps (like Quake), and
one with DooM3-style lighting. Please note that k8vavoom is not a carbon
copy of Vavoom, so full backward compatibility should not be expected.

## GNU/LINUX GAMERS SECTION

### INSTALLATION

If you're on an Arch-based Linux distribution, you may use an AUR package.

For all the other flavours of GNU/Linux you have to compile k8vavoom from
the sources. Make sure you have at least the following libraries in your
system: SDL2, OpenAL, libopus, libvorbis, libflac. Also, you MUST run
`make install` command because k8vavoom won't run from an arbitrary
location.

Please, refer to "docs/k8vavoom.txt" for more info.


### CONFIGURATION

k8vavoom stores its user configuration and supplemental files in the
`~/.k8vavoom` directory.

~/.k8vavoom
   \
   |-autoload
   |   \
   |   |-doom
   |   |  \
   |   |  |-<subdir>
   |   |  |-cool_models.pk3
   |   |  |-autorun.rc
   |   |
   |   |-<game name>
   |
   |-iwads
   |  \
   |  |-DOOM.WAD
   |  |-DOOM2.WAD
   |  |...
   |
   |-sshots
   |
   |-saves
   |
   |-modes.rc

You'd better create "~/.k8vavoom/iwads" directory and put at least one
IWAD file there to play a game. You can specify a game name with the
corresponding command line switch, e.g. -doom, -doom2, -tnt, etc.


#### Autoload

If you want some wad or pk3 resource to be loaded automatically on start,
you can put it into "autoload/<game name>" directory. Sub-directories are
not scanned at the start, but they can be used within "autorun.rc" config
file.

The "autorun.rc" file allows you to define groups of resources, e.g.

```
group "models-weapon" {
  models/mdl_wpn_bfg.pk3
  models/mdl_wpn_chaingun.pk3
  models/mdl_wpn_chainsaw.pk3
  models/mdl_wpn_launcher.pk3
  models/mdl_wpn_plasma.pk3
  models/mdl_wpn_shotgun.pk3
  models/mdl_wpn_ssg.pk3
}
```

So in this example new weapon model will be loaded on start. Command line
switch `-skip-auto <group name>` can be used to disable some groups.


#### Screenshots

Screenshots are saved in the "sshots" directory with the name
`shotXXXX.png`, where XXXX is a counter starting with 0000.


#### Saved games

Games are saved in the "saves" directory under the separate
sub-directories. The sub-directories names are k8vavoom configuration
hashes. This means that saves from the different games (or pwads) won't
be visible under another configurations.

That is, if you've played some WAD without its custom music and decided
to add its *MUS.WAD now, you will not see your previous saves, cause the
game config will be different.

But if you are *ABSOLUTELY* sure that your new wad contains only cosmetic
features that *CANNOT* influence the game, you can use "-cosmetic filename"
CLI argument to avoid savegame invalidation.

To stay on the safe side, use "-cosmetic" only for pwads containing music
and/or sounds. Everything else may break the save, or even the engine.


#### Custom game modes

You can aggregate some customisation setting into groups referred here as
'modes' with the `modes.rc` file. See example:

```
/* options:
  DisableBloodReplacement
    disable all blood replacements (but Gore Mod still can replace blood)
    this effectively disables all custom blood from any mod

  DisableGoreMod
    don't load gore mod, even if it is requested by the user

  DisableBDW
    don't load bdw mod, even if it is requested by the user
*/

mode "d4v" {
  // this is case insensitive, and supports DOS-style globs
  basedir "doom*"
  // this will load pwads before "-file"
  // use `postpwad` command for pwad list to load after "-file"
  pwad "/mnt/bigfoot/vavoom/D4V/D4V.wad"
  // skip autoload groups from "autoload.rc"
  skipauto "brightmap*", "glow", "models-*", "smooth*", "spritefix*", "id0-bm"
  // options
  DisableBDW
  // aliases
  alias "doom4vanilla"
}

```

To select a mode use the command line switch `-mode <mode name>`. For the
given example both `-mode b4v` and `-mode doom4vanilla` will do the trick.
