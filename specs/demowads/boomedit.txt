Obtain BOOM.EXE at http://www.teamtnt.com.
Reference info is in the EDITUTIL.ZIP package there

Hints:

1) If you are stuck in forest of pillars, shoot the room's wall.
2) The yellow skull key is higher than the others. You need to
   die to see it :).
3) On very slow machines it may be helpful to note that TNTICE turns
   off the ice effect and TNTPUSH turns off the wind effect.

================================================================

* General Information *

The wad shows many of the effects possible with the BOOM engine,
and uses text signs to label them, and where appropriate the linedef
type number used to produce them. Reference information on specific
linedefs can be found in BOOMREF.TXT in EDITUTIL.ZIP at
http://www.teamtnt.com.

The elevator switch graphics do not replace switches, but are added
to BOOM's list of known switches thru the SWITCHES lump, generated
using DEMOSWAN.DAT with SWANTBLS.EXE also in the EDITUTIL zip.

The SFALL and NUKAGE1 animations have been sped up by a factor of 4
thru the ANIMATED lump, also done with SWANTBLS.EXE and DEMOSWAN.DAT.
Animations can be sped up by as much as a factor of 8 and slowed down
as much as desired.

The flat used on the ice lake is contained in the PWAD between
F_START and F_END, and the replacement tree sprite is between S_START
and S_END markers in the PWAD. BOOM will load flats and sprites from the
PWAD, unlike DOOM.

The stained glass column in the translucency demo uses a custom
translucency lump at 40% translucency, made with BOOM and the
utility MAKTRLMP included in EDITUTIL.

Custom colormaps, made with CMAPTOOL.EXE, also in EDITUTIL.ZIP are
used for underwater, under-ice, and under-lava lighting, as well as a
special demo room demonstrating their use as a primitive colored
lighting effect.

The music is a directly embedded MIDI, not a MUS lump.
