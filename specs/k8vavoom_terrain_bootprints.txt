k8vavoom terrain extensions and bootprint definition, v0.90
===========================================================


terrain
=======

everything that is at https://zdoom.org/wiki/TERRAIN is supported (as of May, 2021).

in addition, you can modify an existing terrain by redefining it like:

  terrain Name modify {
    ...
  }

the difference between this and standard terrain override is that without "modify"
keyword, existing terrain will be reset to default values. if you'll try to modify
the definition that wasn't yet defined, "modify" will be ignored.

there are extended options for terrain, which should be usedin "k8vavoom" block.

  terrain Name {
    ...
    k8vavoom {
      ...
    }
  }

this is done so other engines could simply skip the extensions without knowing how to
parse k8vavoom options.


extended options are:

noprotection
  removes "allowprotection" flag.

notliquid
  removes "liquid" flag.

nodamageonland
  removes "damageonland" flag.

playeronly
  this terrain definition is applied only for players. for other entities, default
  terrain will be used.

everybody
  removes "playeronly" flag.

optout
  if "gm_vanilla_liquids" cvar is false, default terrain will be returned instead of this one.

nooptout
  removes "optout" flag.

bootprint <name>
  bootprint definition for this terrain.
  note that bootprint flat (specified in bootprint definition) has higher priority.

detectfloorflat <globmask>
  flats matching this globmask will be marked as belonging to this terrain.
  this option can be specified several times, and it is cumulative.
  "globmask" is a wildcard expression, it supports "*" and ranges in "[]"


"land step sound" will be used when a player or a monster landed on the given terrain.
"small object" is the object with a mass less than 10, or with "small splash" flag set.
landing sound will be played regardless of splash object presence. i.e. you can use
landing sound to avoid spawning dummy splash objects. this sound will be played for both
liquids and normal terrains.

landvolume <float>
  landing sound volume, [0..1]. default is 1.0.

landsound <soundname>
  landing sound name.

smalllandvolume <float>
  "small object" landing sound volume, [0..1]. default is 1.0.

smalllandsound <soundname>
  "small object" landing sound name.


NOTE: footsteps are not implemented yet. the following options will be parsed, but
      will do nothing yet. they will be implemented in the future, though.

stepvolume <float>
  footstep sound volume, [0..1]. default is 1.0.

walkingsteptime <float>
  footstep sound interval when walking, in seconds. default is 0.0 (no sound).

runningsteptime <float>
  footstep sound interval when running, in seconds. default is 0.0 (no sound).

leftstepsound <soundname>
  sound for the left foot.

rightstepsound <soundname>
  sound for the right foot.

stepsound <soundname>
  assign the given sound for both feets.


bootprint
=========

this is bootprint definition section. example:

  bootprint VanillaWater {
    decal  WaterLiquidBootPrint
    time   default
    flat   "fwater[0-9]"
  }

bootprint redifinition completely removes old bootprint, including any flats for it.
i.e. redefined bootprint will not be assigned to any flats. you can use "modify" to
modify an existing bootprint. if you'll try to modify the definition that wasn't yet
defined, "modify" wiil be ignored.

note that bootprint decal should be done for the right foot. it will be mirrored for
the left foot. the engine will automatically apply some offset too, so decal sprite
"center point" should be roughly at the center of the decal.


booptprint options:

decal <name>
  decal name for this bootprint

time <default | min max>
  how long the player should leave bootprints, in seconds?
  "default" is some default value (around 4.0 seconds).
  you can specify minimum and maximum time instead, and the engine will choose something
  in that range (inclusive) at random.

flat <globmask>
  globlask for flats that leaves this bootprint. this option is cumulative.
