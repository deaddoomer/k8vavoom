k8vavoom extended attributes for point light things
===================================================

A point light thing takes four arguments:
    1: Red value of the light
    2: Green value of the light
    3: Blue value of the light
    4: Intensity value of the light

k8vavoom extension:
  5th argument is light flags.
  bits 7 and 6 should be always set to indicate that the flags are valid.
  other bits:
    0: no shadows
    1: no actor shadows
    2: no actor light

  please, note that bits 3-5 should NOT be set!

  so, valid flag values are:
      0: normal light with proper shadows
    193: this light casts no shadows (but will still be clipped by map geometry)
    194: this light won't cast actor shadows
    195: the same as 193
    196: this light won't lit actors
    197: this light won't lit actors, and will cast no shadows
    198: this light won't lit actors, and won't cast actor shadows
    199: the same as 198
