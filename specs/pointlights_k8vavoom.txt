k8vavoom extended attributes for point light things
===================================================

A point light thing takes four arguments:
    1: Red value of the light
    2: Green value of the light
    3: Blue value of the light
    4: Intensity value of the light

k8vavoom extension:
  5th argument is light flags.
  bits 7 and 6 should be always set to indicate that the flags are valid.
  other bits:
    0: no shadows (including actor shadows)
    1: no actor shadows
    2: no actor light
    3: don't clip with geometry (this light won't cast geometry shadows, but may cast actor shadows)

  please, note that bits 4-5 should NOT be set!

  so, valid flag values are:
      0: normal light with proper shadows

    193: this light casts no shadows (but will still be clipped by map geometry)
    194: this light won't cast actor shadows
    195: the same as 193
    196: this light won't lit actors
    197: this light won't lit actors, and will cast no shadows
    198: this light won't lit actors, and won't cast actor shadows
    199: the same as 198

    200: this light won't be clipped with the geometry, and won't cast any geometry shadows (but may cast actor shadows)
    201: this light won't be clipped with the geometry, and won't cast any shadows
    202: this light won't cast actor shadows, won't be clipped with the geometry, and won't cast any geometry shadows
    203: the same as 201
    204: this light won't lit actors, won't be clipped with the geometry, and won't cast any geometry shadows
    205: this light won't lit actors, won't be clipped with the geometry, and won't cast any shadows
