This is description of k8vavoom 3d polyobject: how to create them, how to
use them, and, most important, how to NOT use them.
</p>

<p>
Think of 3D polyobject as if it is a moving solid sector. Normal Doom
sectors are empty inside, i.e. they have empty space between their floors
and ceilings. 3D polyobject is the inverse of that: it has solid space
between its floor and ceiling, and you can stand on its ceiling (which
will look like platform floor for the player).

<a id="drawit"></a><h1>How to create 3d polyobject</h1>
<p>
Drawing 3d polyobjects is very easy, it is not much different from
drawing a standard polyobject. Please, refer to any polyobject
documentation. I will only describe the differences here.
</p>

<p>
Each 3d polyobject should consist of one sector, created with closed contours.
The shape and the number of the contours can be arbitrary, as long as all contours
are closed, and there are no self-intersections. All lines should point <b>outside</b>
of that "inner" sector, and should be marked as "impassable". Of course, those lines
should be two-sided. ;-)
</p>

<p>
Please, note that breaking any requirement may lead to undefined result. I.e. your
invalid 3d polyobject may work, and you may even get some fancy effects, but there are
no guarantees that it will keep working in any following engine build.
<div style="font-size:140%;color:#c00;">
<b>PLEASE, DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT IS NOT EXPLICITLY DESCRIBED AS ALLOWED IN THIS DOCUMENT!</b>
</div>
</p>

<p>
Here is the picture for you.
</p>
<img src="fig1.png" />

<p>
There are two sectors on the picture. "Inner sector" is 3d polyobject sector. As you can see,
its shape is not convex, but it is closed, and all lines points outside of it. The outer sector
is just a "container" for polyobject. It will not be visible in-game.
</p>
<p>
You can place normal polyobject anchor thing to mark the anchor point of your 3d polyobject.
If you will not do it, the engine will select some point on its own. It will try to select a
point close to polyobject center, but it is not guaranteed. The algorithm to calculate center
point may change in the future, so you should <b>ALWAYS</b> use anchor things.
</p>
<p>
Inner sector height will be used as 3d polyobject height. But please, note that maximum height is
limited by middle texture height, if you won't set your middle texture as wrapping. Inner sector
floor texture will be the bottom 3d polyobject texture, and ceiling texture will become the top one.
</p>
<p>
To align floor and ceiling textures, just align your inner sector as you want to. The inner sector
will be "cutted out" as it is, and will retain its flat align no matter how you'll move it.
</p>

<a id="spawnit"><h1>How to spawn 3d polyobject</h1>
<p>
To spawn your 3d polyobject, you should use new thing with editor number <b>9369</b>.
It's height will specify initial z offset <b>from the inner sector</b>. NOT from the destination one!
The angle is the polyobject tag, as in other polyobject spawners.<br>
<b>arg1</b> is the sum of 3d pobj flags (see `<code>POBJ_FLAG_xxx</code>` below).<br>
<i>Note: if `<code>POBJ_FLAG_SIDE_CRUSH</code>` is set, entity will be destroyed if it was touched
by a moving 3d pobj side. This is useful to create vertical crushers, because otherwise crushing
3d pobj can try to push an entity away if it is close to the edge. Also, this flag does nothing if
`<code>POBJ_FLAG_CRUSH</code>` is not set.</i><br>
<b>WARNING! Other things args must be zero! They may be used later, and if you will not set them
to zeroes, your map may break in the future!</b>
</p>


<hr>
<a id="linkit"><h1>Linked 3d polyobjects</h1>
<p>
There is a new feature you can use to create complex structures out of simple polyobjects: polyobject links.
It is somewhat similar to linked sectors you could use to create complex lifts.
</p>
<p>
Linked polyobjects will behave as one object, and all operations on the first polyojbect in the link will
affect all "child" objects. All operations on the link chain are atomic. I.e. if moving/rotating is failed,
no objects in chain will be modified. Just think about the link chain as one big object.
</p>
<p>
To link polyobjects, use things with editor id <b>9368</b>. Its first argument is a master polyobject id,
its second argument is a secondary polyobject id. It will link the secondary polyobject to the master.
Note that you cannot link two or more polyobject to one master, so to create complex structures you have
to link all polyobjects one to another, creating a "link chain". Linking all polyobjects to a single master
<b>will not work</b>.
</p>


<hr>
<a id="movenote"><h1>Notes about movement</h1>
<p>
You can move your 3d polyobject by all three axes, and it will carry all things standing on it. Currently
it works like a platform in arcade games: it carries things, but doesn't modify their velocities. This means
that if the player will jump while riding some 3d polyobject, the jump will be strictly vertical (and the
platform will move away). I may add flags to make "non-arcade" platforms later, but for now there is only
one platform type available.
</p>
<p>
Rotating 3d polyobject is allowed too. As you may expect, all things standing on such 3d polyobject will be
properly rotated. Floor and ceiling textures will be rotated too (around polyobject anchor point).
You can rotate 3d pobj only around Z axis (i.e. the same way non-3d pobjs are rotated). This limitation
won't be removed.
</p>
<p>
Currently, you cannot stack several entities on top of each other and make them move with the 3d polyobject.
I.e. some solid entity that is standing on some other solid entity will block the whole movement, and may
be crushed (because it is considered as "blocking" one).
