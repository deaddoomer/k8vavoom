You will start with two ACOLYTEs of the Order trying to kill you!  Get in close and punch them until you have dispatched them.  They should drop  a pass key that will allow you to go out the door and along the edge of the sewage plant.
<P>
<IMG SRC="Harris.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>Go through the door on your left, and talk to HARRIS (face him and press the space bar to initiate a conversation).  He will send  you on a mission to recover the CHALICE from the SANCTUARY.  He will give you a crossbow to help you accomplish this task. (DON'T fire your crossbow in the town- you will set off the alarms,  ensuring your demise.  Use your fists if you need to kill silently). 
<P>
Continue along the walkway and go out the opening on the left, which leads to the town.  Turn left and head past the tavern and down the steps.  When you get to the river (don't cross the bridge),  turn right and you will see the entrance to the sanctuary. The Acolyte standing there will not let you in through the door.   Drop down into the river and walk onto the little wooden dock there. this will give you access to the inside of the Sanctuary.  
<P>
When you're inside the sanctuary, open the big door and use your crossbow to  kill the Acolyte standing on the platform ahead of you.  Turn to the right, grab the ammo and health, and go up on the lift platform.   Go through the door and you will pass the room with the Chalice  (on your right) and the room with the switch to turn off the force  field (on your left).  The switch room is locked.  Turn left and  go up the stairs.  Kill the Acolyte at the top of the stairs and throw the switch behind him.    Now go back down the stairs and turn right- you can go down the long  hallway there, and throw the switch at the end.  This will raise the walkway below and to your right, allowing you to cross the water area (jump into the water and get onto the platform if you don't want to go around the long way).  After crossing the platform, go through the door and get on the platform there.
<P>
When you get to the top, a prisoner behind the door on the left will tell you something interesting.  Then continue back and turn left, and go through the door there- you will have to kill a red Acolyte who will drop the key to the switch room.  You can also grab some health and ammo.
<P>
<IMG SRC="Chalice.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>Return to the switch room near the chalice, go inside, and grab the Assault gun.  Throw the switch.  Now you can enter the room with the Chalice in it and grab the chalice.  At this point, you should return to town and head for the tavern.
<P>
The Acolytes in the tavern will attack you while you are carrying the chalice, so defend yourself (the Assault gun works best).  Then go up  the stairs and open the door on your right.  (Save your game at this point if you want to try out two different possibilities).
<P>

<P>
You will meet Harris again, but this is where the story branches- if you give him the chalice, he'll send you to meet the governor, but it's a setup!  If you kill Harris instead of giving him the chalice, he will reveal a secret switch that allows you to go into his basement.  Grab the stuff there, including the COM UNIT.
<P>
When you leave the basement, the COM UNIT will activate, and you will receive directions from BLACKBIRD, the FRONT's secret agent.  Drop the Chalice (Use insert/delete to select it in your inventory, then hit backspace).  Then follow her directions to the Governor's place and open the door to your left once inside.  This will lead you to the FLAMETHROWER.
<P>
When you grab the loot and the Flamethrower, you will set off an alarm.  At this point, you want to get back to the town, and use the Flamethrower to destroy the CRUSADERS (the big robots).  (<FONT COLOR=GHOSTWHITE>HINT</FONT>: the Environmental Suit will protect you from their flamers if you put it on).
<P>
Once you have destroyed the Crusaders, a secret entrance to the FRONT's base will be revealed (located to the right of the weapons shop).  Head inside and jump on the TELEPORTER (the swirly yellow thing).  This will take you to the FRONT's base, where you can meet MACIL.
<P>
Macil will tell you more about what is happening in the world of STRIFE.  At this point, you can end the TEASER by throwing the EXIT switch.
<P>
Congratulations!!!  You have completed the teaser.  Now for some  real fun, check  out multiplayer with your friends!(insert link to multiplayer teaser) The Retail version should now be available in stores.  Check with your local distributor.
