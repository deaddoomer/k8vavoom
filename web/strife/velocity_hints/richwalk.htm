<B>Getting to the Order Commons:</B>
<P>
Go to the Borderlands.  Head toward the wood lined buildings where the Keymaster hangs out (Notice the "COMMONS" signs on either side of the main door). Go through the main door, and straight ahead is another large door that requires a Brass key.  You should have a brass key, given to you by Macil.  Go through the door, and you will enter the Order Commons area.

<B>Finding Richter:</B>
<P>
Go through the right door- you should see a large courtyard.  Go right (towards the water) and drop down.  You should see the waterfall on your right. Stand with your back to the waterfall, facing the building.  You should see two windows- that's the room Richter's in.  Go through the small door on the left side of the building, then turn right and go up the stairs.  Take the small door on the right (1/2 way up the stairs).  Inside is a guy with green robes- that's Richter.
