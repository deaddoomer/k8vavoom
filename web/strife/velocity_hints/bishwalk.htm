These tips will help you take him out:

<OL>
	<LI>Make SURE you hit the Stores before taking on the Bishop.  The Stores are also known as the Warehouse - Quincy mentions that's where the Mauler is kept.  Be sure to get the Mauler.  You can get to the Stores from the Bailey.  The stores takes a while to explore, but is loaded with goodies (including some hidden shadow armor and a vault full of gold!).  (See the accompanying walkthrough for the Mauler). The Bailey itself also has some nice little secret stashes, so keep your eyes peeled.</LI>
<P>
	<LI>When you arrive at the tower, kill the crusaders that are at ground level on either side of the entrance. Then, fire grenades into the two towers immediately above and bookending the front door.  Then, fire incendiary grenades up onto the walkways and lure the Templars and Crusaders into the flames - this saves a lot of time.</LI>
<P>
	<LI>Slowly clear out each area and watch for switches.   The tower is bilaterally symmetrical, so whatever you have to do on one side should immediately be duplicated on the other side.  Each set of switches brings you closer to the Bishop.</LI>
<P>
	<LI>Engage Crusaders with your Flamethrower at close range - constant damage prevents them from getting shots off, and if you're close enough, they won't fire rockets (only the occasional flamer).  Flamers also work well against Templars, just stay on target.  Use the Assault gun or Missile launcher for other targets to spread out your ammo consumption.</LI>
<P>
	<LI>There are two areas below some of the walkways that have stashes - just jump over the railing, shoot the stalkers below, and collect your loot.  You have to use a secret tunnel to get out of these areas, but they're not too bad.  Also, check the monitor glass behind the Bishop for secrets.</LI>
<P>
	<LI>Metal armor and shadow armor will help you survive these engagements prior to taking on the Bishop.  Remember that the last two templars and the Bishop himself can teleport, so keep your eyes peeled and watch your back.  </LI>
<P>
	<LI>The Bishop's specter cannot be harmed by conventional weapons: you have to use the Sigil. Since the Sigil uses your health as ammo, be sure to bring as many health packs as possible, and make sure your Sigil blasts actually hit the specter.  If you get really desperate, you can even buy some health from the medic in the Bailey (in the hospital, next to Quincy).  If you've been keeping up on your stat increases, the Field Surgery kits are worth the money.</LI>
