<B>To get to Worner, the Spy:</B>
<P>
When you first enter the Power Station, head down the long hallway, go down the lift, and turn right.  That leads you to the WAREHOUSE area.  Turn left at the sign, then go through the first door on your right (where the FOREMAN is).  Throw the switch there.  That opens the gates to the lower area.    Make your way through the crates until you get to WORNER (<FONT COLOR=GHOSTWHITE>HINT</FONT>: lots of goodies are stashed in amongst the crates).  When you get to Worner, he’ll give you an ID card (the Power1 Key).    Now you can get into the Power Station Core area.  
<P>
<B>To get the Second Key (the Suicide Run):</B>
<P>
Enter the power station area (you can check with the guard if you like).  You’ll see a large room with water in it (the COOLANT ROOM).  Immediately hang a left.  Follow the walkway around the water and throw the switch that raises the steps.  Go up the steps and through the doorway- unfortunately, it’s alarmed!   Turn left and follow the hallway until you get to a bridge.  Go across the bridge, kill the guard, and throw the switch there.    Now turn right and go down the stairs.   Follow the catwalk around the pit (don’t fall in!).  Keep going until you get to a lift, and take that up.   Turn left and walk around to the stairs.  Go down the stairs, turn left, and talk to the Technician there (watch out for Stalkers).  He’ll give you the Power-2 Key.  You can go back the way you came if you want, or go down the lift beyond the technician to do the SUICIDE RUN and then to BREAK the TERMINAL screen (this raises the water around the crystal, making it a bit safer once you get there).
<P>
<B>To get the Third Key from Sammis and blow the Crystal:</B>
<P>
Go back to the COOLANT ROOM, and head for the door to the POWER CRYSTAL area. Throw the switch there.  You should see a large, short hallway with a small room on your left.  Grab the environmental suit and med patches from the room, then open the far door with the switch.  (You’ll hear a low throbbing sound in there).  You'll see a tall column ahead - the crystal is in there.  But to get access to it, first  you want to find a guy named SAMMIS.  Turn right and go through the little doorway (into a very noisy area).  Get inside the center ring (don't forget your environmental suit!) and go up the lift to get to SAMMIS.  He'll give  you a key that lets you take an elevator (the Power-3 Key).  Take the key, throw the switches behind SAMMIS and head back out to the big core area.  Go across the walkway (either one) until you reach an elevator.  Take the elevator up, and find KETRICK.  Throw the switch behind Ketrick, and blow up the crystal with your Assault gun or Micro Missile Launcher (if you found one yet). This  will set off the alarm if Ketrick hasn't done so already...  Now get out of  the Power station and Blackbird will guide you from there. 
<P>
<B>The Weapons:</B>
<P>
There’s a section of the Power station you don’t need to go to at all, up near the top center of the map.  In that area is a WEAPON TECHNICIAN that tells you about a weapons shipment.  If you kill him, he’ll drop a gold key.  Take that key back to the WAREHOUSE.  Go around the right side of the warehouse ( be sure to throw the switch in the guard room) and watch for a little red laser tripwire on your left.  Hop over the tripwire, and open the door at the end (if it has a forcefield on it, you have to be sure to shut it off with the switch in the guard room opposite you).  Inside you’ll find some WEAPONS…
<P>
<B>The Secret Entrance:</B>
<P>
There’s a secret way into the POWER STATION!  Remember that if you kill with stealth you won’t set off the alarms.  Silently get to WORNER(as above).  After Worner gives you the power-1 key, go out on the docks outside the warehouse and walk around to the left.  Watch the stone wall  on your right for an opening.  Go in the opening, jumping up the waterfall steps, and turn right when you see  grey brick.  Grab the two med patches hidden in the water next to the spigot, then jump up on the  ledge and throw the switch on your left to open the gate.  Drop down  to the floor, and turn left and go down the stairs.  Down below is the WEAPON TECHNICIAN- kill him silently to get the gold key.  Go back up the stairs, then to the right and down the other stairs.  Go around the left side of the columns and grab the loot.  Then go on the platform and jump down into the water.  Wade toward the tan technician and jump up to him via the corner.  Throw the switch behind him, then follow the pipe on the ceiling to your right and drop down below.  Look around for a Medkit, then drop down into the water.  Go out the doorway into the COOLANT ROOM area, and jump up the waterfall to get up on the walkway.  Turn left and go out the big door (you have to open it with the switch inside the little guard room on the left).  Head back to the Warehouse, go around the right side, and follow the directions above for getting the weapons.
<P>
Now, go back outside and around the docks to that secret entrance again.  When you drop down to the floor, go down the steps straight ahead but this time go on the right side of the two pillars.  The third indentation on your right is a secret door!  Open it, and go into the air duct.  Go up the lift (<FONT COLOR=GHOSTWHITE>NOTE</FONT>- if you didn’t throw the switch behind the tan technician, this lift won’t work!).  Watch out for the Sentinel- punch him out if you want to be stealthy.   Follow the duct until it drops down, then open the door.  You’ll come out in the area where SAMMIS is, not too far from  the crystal! Get inside the center ring (don't forget your environmental suit!) and go up the lift to get to Sammis.  He'll give  you a key that lets you take an elevator (the Power-3 Key).  Take the key, throw the switches behind Sammis and head down the hallway and out to the BIG humming area.  Go across the walkway (either one) until you reach an elevator.  Take the elevator up, and find KETRICK.  Throw the switch behind Ketrick, and blow up the crystal with your Assault gun or Micro Missile Launcher. This  will set off the alarm if Ketrick hasn't done so already...  Now get out of  the Power station and Blackbird will guide you from there.
