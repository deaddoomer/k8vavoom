<B>Locating the Stores:</B>
<P>
The Fortress: Stores  is a level of it’s own that can be reached from the Fortress Bailey.  If you’ve talked to Quincy, he tells you about the Maulers (the Warehouse and the Stores are the same place).    To get to the Stores from Quincy, exit the Hospital and turn right at the fountain.    Then turn left when you see the orange force field on the door above the vine covered walkway (if you haven’t already turned the field off).  Then turn right at the steps and walk up them towards another door with an orange force field.  Turn right and enter the small guard post there.  Inside is a small switch- throw it to shut off the orange force fields.    Exit the guard room and go in the door on your right.  Take the lift straight ahead.  When you get to the top,   you’ll see a low wall ahead of you.  Hop over the wall and go down the stairs there.  You’ll see a sign over a door that reads "warehouse".  Go through the door and you’ll transition to the Fortress: Stores area.

<B>Infiltrating the Hub:</B>
<P>
Once in the Stores, go up the stairs on your left.  If you're going to kill any acolytes, use poison arrows to avoid setting of the alarms. Run all the way down the long hallway (past any lifts or steps on your right).  Follow the hallway when it turns to the right (notice the turrets on the ceiling at every corner?).  Keep running all the way around, following the hallway, until it goes up some steps and to the right.  Be careful!  Stop running, and slowly walk up the stairs until you see a small switch on your right.  Don’t fall down the pit ahead- throw the switch and then walk across when the floor raises up.  Then, walk up the stairs to your left, and silently kill the guard and grab the Mauler key that he drops.  Then, go back across the pit (using the switch to raise the floor), and go back down the long hallway until you get to the corner with the lift on your left and two lights on the ceiling.   Take the lift down, and grab all the loot you see in that room.  When you get to the front of the room, you’ll see a large number 1 on the floor right in front of a door.  You can open the door, but a barrier will block your exit.  Directly opposite that door are three steps up to another door.  Go up the steps and in the door, and  throw the switch inside there.  That will raise the barrier.  Now if you open the #1 door, you’ll see the hub of the Stores, but be careful- a Reaver will be waiting, and at this point, you’ll have to set off the alarms to kill him (if you haven’t set them off already).   
<P>
<B>Grab that Mauler:</B>
<P>
When you enter the hub, the door on your right  (with the green alarm lights) leads to the Maulers.  Go through the door (you’ll see a #4 on the floor)  and find the conveyor belt.  Jump on the belt, then get off and go to the right.  Fire some grenades in  the windows on your left to take out the Reaver and any Templars in there.  Then take the stairs on your right,  take the lift up, then go around to your left and take the other lift down.  Keep your Flamethrower handy- more Templars might be waiting for you down there!  You’ll see some Maulers and energy cells just waiting to be picked up.
<P>
<B>Loot, Loot, and More Loot:</B>
<P>
Don’t leave yet - be sure to check out all four areas thoroughly for health, ammo and armor.  Search section #3 especially well- there’s lots of goodies and secrets in there!  To get out of the Stores, take the stairs up from the hub that run between section 2 and 3, then turn left, go up the steps on the right, and turn left again to get back to the entrance.
