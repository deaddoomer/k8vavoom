	<TD>There are two major paths (called A and B, or the Dark and Light path) through the last part of the story.  The critical branching point is where, after killing the Bishop, you return to the Oracle and he tells you that you must kill Macil!  If you decide to believe the Oracle, and you kill Macil, you go down the "dark" A path.  The Oracle will open a teleporter up in his chambers that will take you to the Proving Grounds, then on to the Lab where you must kill the Loremaster.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD>If you don’t believe the Oracle and kill him, you go down the "Light" B path.  Macil will send you to meet Richter, a Front spy who works in the Order Commons.  If you end up on the B path, you see a lot more of the game  (8 whole areas worth!).  It takes longer, but you get more stat increases, and you get a happier ending.</TD>

	<TD>There are three different slide show endings that can be seen in Strife.   If you die while fighting the entity, you get the Sad ending (and it’s really dark.)  If you defeat the Entity but you took the "A" path, you get the "Okay" ending .  If you defeat the Entity and you took the "B" path, you get the "Good" ending (where you meet a friendly, warm, not too shabby looking Blackbird).</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2>So which one is the real ending?  Well, after you’ve seen them all,  you can decide for yourself (or have an intense, brooding theoretical discussion with your friends.)</TD>

<P>
<B>Here’s some other branching points in the story.  They don’t lead to different endings, but they can make your life easier, more difficult, or more profitable.</B>
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>The Governor’s tasks (Kill Derwin or bring back the Power Coupling).  And of course, whether you find the replacement coupling or destroy the main one, thereby needing to kill the scanning crew.</LI>
	<LI>The normal route or the secret route through the Power Station.  The secret route involves going out around the docks and up through the little drainage area, and is the quickest way to get the gold key.  You can actually get into the room with Sammis too by throwing a switch, then going in a secret door near the guy with the gold key (see the map for details).</LI>
	<LI>The normal route or the secret route into the Oracle’s chamber.  If you drop down below where the water drains right near the beginning of the level, you can hop your way through the secret route (but don’t fall).  You can also get down into the drainage area from outside the entrance.</LI>
	<LI>Harris’ mission.  Of course, this is just a setup - you don’t want to touch the chalice (unless you have already gotten the prison pass from the governor, but even then.).  Try killing Harris after he sends you to get the Chalice, and you get a nice little bonus.</LI>
