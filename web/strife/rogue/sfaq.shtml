<p>
Questions and comments to:  <a href="mailto:strife@rogue-ent.com">strife@rogue-ent.com</a>
<p>
<font face="sans-serif"><i><b>General Info</b></i></font>
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>[Q]</b> Is the registered version of Strife out?
<dd><b>[A]</b> Yes! If your local computer store still is plugging Doom II as the
	"Latest Hot Title", then try Cyberian Outpost at http://www.cybout.com/.<p>
<dt><b>[Q]</b> Is Strife available on Floppy Disk?
<dd><b>[A]</b> No. Due to the storage requirements of Strife, it's not practical for Velocity to produce and distribute it on floppy.
</dl>
<p>

<font face="sans-serif"><i><b>Setup / Configuration</b></i></font>
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>[Q]</b> Can I run Strife under QEMM?
<dd><b>[A]</b> No. It's best to run Strife with as little loaded on your machine
	as possible. You can make yourself a boot disk, or if you're more
	inclined, a multiple configuration CONFIG.SYS (under later versions
	of DOS only).
<p>
<dt><b>[Q]</b> What TSRs and drivers should I have installed?
<dd><b>[A]</b> You need very few things for Strife to run properly.
<ol>
<li>Most sound cards are supported directly through Strife's sound code, so drivers for your sound card may not be necessary.
<li>You do need a mouse driver installed if you intend on using a mouse to play Strife.
<li>You will see a bit of a performance improvement from a disk cache program (SMARTDRV, etc.). However, don't go overboard on the amount of memory to dedicate to it. There doesn't seem to be much of a reason to give it more than about 512k. In general, the more memory Strife has to play with, the better.
<li>You will need your network drivers installed if you intend on playing Strife over an IPX network.
</ol>
<p>
<dt><b>[Q]</b> Is there a way to save a game in more than one slot? 
<dd><b>[A]</b> No, there is no way to save to more than one slot. We limited it
	to one slot due to the size of save games in the later episodes.
	Don't forget that you do have the auto-save slot that the game 
	makes when you transition levels. If you start a level, or each 
	time you return to that level, the game does an auto-save. If you 
	mess up, or save accidently, you can die, then hit the spacebar 
	to re-start at the last entry point.
<p>
<dt><b>[Q]</b> Does Strife have a co-op mode?
<dd><b>[A]</b> No, Strife does not have co-op per se. Multiplayer in Strife consists
	of starting a deathmatch game and then having all players try and
	fight their way to the next level. There are no co-op start points,
	so all of your players will wind up on deathmatch points, possibly
	in the middle of a bunch of bad guys.
<p>
<dt><b>[Q]</b> Does Strife run under OS/2?
<dd><b>[A]</b> Strife has not been tested under OS/2 by either Rogue or Velocity.
	However, it should run as well as Doom did. If you can find the
	settings for Doom, you can use them for Strife with one exception.
	Remember, Strife requires 7MB of free DPMI memory to run properly,
	so you will need to make sure that much is being allocated. If
	you can spare it, give Strife 8-8.5 MB of DPMI memory, and it will
	use that extra memory. Giving Strife more than 8.5 MB of memory 
	will be a waste as the Doom engine only asks for 8 MB.

<font face="sans-serif"><i><b>Other Stuff</b></i></font>

<dl>
<dt><b>[Q]</b> Are there any guides out yet, with maps and so forth?
<dd><b>[A]</b> No. There aren't any clue books out yet, but some are in the works.
<p>
<dt><b>[Q]</b> Is there a patch for Strife 1.0 shareware?
<dd><b>[A]</b> No. The current version of the Strife Demo (a.k.a. shareware) is version
	1.1. This includes the multiplayer options omitted from Demo 1.0.
<p>
<dt><b>[Q]</b> Is there a patch for Registered Strife?
<dd><b>[A]</b> Yes. The current version of Strife is v1.2. This fixes a problem in
	multiplayer that we didn't quite nail down until a few days after the
	registered version shipped to manufacturing. It also contains a few minor
	tweaks to clean up the wad file (mis-aligned textures and such). It is
	available at http://www.gamers.org/~rogue/strife.html and on 
	http://www.velocitygames.com/
<p>
<dt><b>[Q]</b> Are there any Strife Editors?
<dd><b>[A]</b> To an extent, yes. DeeP and WinTex (and probably others) are starting to support
	Strife. Here are a few points to find out more:
	http://www.wolfenet.com/~sbs/index.html - For info on DeeP
	http://www.cybernet.dk/users/jensh/doom/wintex/wintex.html - For info on WinTex

WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS. READ AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>[Q]</b> What are the cheat codes for Strife???
<dd><b>[A]</b> We're generally not handing them out, hoping people will play
	through the game as intended. However, people have figured them
	out and posted them on the UseNet
<p>
<dt><b>[Q]</b> I can't find Richter!
<dd><b>[A]</b> Richter is in the Commons. The Commons are located inside of the
	Borderlands. In the Borderlands, if you go to the right once inside
	of the walled-in area, you'll see the entrance to the Commons. Go
	through there. Once in the Commons, turn to your right and walk along 
	the pathway and go right off the ledge near the waterfall. Stop. Look 
	to your left. You'll see a set of stairs and a doorway. Go through the
	door. Go up the stairs and there will be a door on your right. He's 
	inside the room through that doorway. Good luck.
<p>
<dt><b>[Q]</b> I just killed someone, and a giant blob appeared above him. I can't seem to
	hurt it, and it kicks my ass. Help!
<dd><b>[A]</b> What you need to do is use the Sigil. The Sigil is the only weapon that
	will harm the 'blob'. The Sigil is weapon #8, but be careful, when you
	fire it, it will drain part of your health.
