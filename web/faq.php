<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<hr width="100%" class="divider" /><div>
<a class="faq">Why don't you add Vavoom to allegro.cc ?</a><br />
It's already added a long time ago (since version 1.0).</div><br />

<div><hr width="100%" class="divider" />
<a class="faq">Is it based on DosDoom (since it uses Allegro)?</a><br />
Not exactly. Since I was not familiar with DJGPP and Allegro, I used
sources of DosDoom, Doom Legacy and Boom to set up system specific modules.
But all non-system specific code was from original Doom sources. When I
started to work with Heretic and Hexen sources I used my Doom port.</div><br />

<div><hr width="100%" class="divider" />
<a class="faq">It seems to be the only DOS Doom port which is under developing
now?</a><br />
No, there are DOS versions of Doom Legacy and EDGE.</div><br />

<div><hr width="100%" class="divider" />
<a class="faq">The MIDI music sounds way off from how it sounds in original
Doom, or even ZDoom or Legacy.</a><br />
Windows version uses DirectMusic, which sounds different. DOS and Linux
vesions sound like ZDoom and Legacy.</div><br />

<div><hr width="100%" class="divider" />
<a class="faq">Is there any documentation on progs and scripts?</a><br />
Vavoom C language documentation is in development. Already in version 1.9
there were included an initial version, which will be extended. Scripts are
the same as in Hexen and ZDoom, and there are some new ones as well.
More info will be included in editing reference.</div><br />

<div><hr width="100%" class="divider" />
<a class="faq">Is there a command line parameter that makes Vavoom start
in 8-bit color mode? My card has problems with 16-bit modes (all I see is
garbage on the screen).</a><br />
By default Vavoom starts in 8-bit mode. You can try command line argument
"+screen_bpp 8".</div><br />
