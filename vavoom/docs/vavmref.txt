Filesystem
******************************************************************************

  Vavoom is now using a filesystem similar to the one of Quake.

  The "game directory" is the first tree on the search path and directory
that all generated files (savegames, screenshots, demos, config files) will
be saved to. This can be overridden with the "-game" or "-devgame" command
line parameter. "-devgame" option is used to put Vavoom into game development
mode. This means that for some wad lumps Vavoom first tries to load them from
files. In current version they are:

    levels     - maps/<level-name>.wad
    progs      - progs/<name>.dat
    
  For each game directory Vavoom searches for base.txt script file. It is
used to setup game directory on which this game is based on. It consists of
list of entries with the following format:

    game <gamedir>
    [iwad <iwad-file>]
    [param <option>]
    end

  where

    gamedir   - game directory of this game.
    iwad-file - main wad file needed for this game.
    option    - when multiple iwad files are present this command line option
              can be used to force selection this game.

  The entries are procesed in backwards order.

  If "-game" and "-devgame" options are not used, basev/games.txt script is
used to detect game. The format is same as base.txt script.
    
  The game directory can nevr be changed while Vavoom is executing. This is a
precacution against having a malicious server instruct clients to write files
over areas they shouldn't.

  WAD files are added in the following order:
    - main wad file;
    - for each game directory all wad files in form wad0.wad, wad1.wad ...
      until one is missing;
    - files specified with "-file" option.
