1. Introduction
*****************************************************************************

    Vavoom is a source port based on sources of Doom, Heretic, Hexen and
  "a little bit" from Quake. Supported platforms are DOS, Windows and LINUX.
  A dedicated server also can be compiled on OpenBSD and possibly on other
  UNIX systems, but this may require some changes.
    If you find any bugs, feel free to report them.

*****************************************************************************
2. Requirements
*****************************************************************************

Vavoom System Requirements:
     - Pentium processor or better
     - 32 MB RAM
     - optional: Sound card
     - optional: CD-ROM
     - Windows version: DirectX 7 (http://www.microsoft.com/directx)

*** IMPORTANT!: Vavoom requires a floating point processor.
Systems that do not have an FPU installed will not run Vavoom -- at all.

  To play Vavoom you need main wad file from one of the following games:
     - Doom shareware
     - Registered Doom
     - Ultimate Doom
     - Doom 2: Hell on Earth
     - Doom 2: TNT Evilution
     - Doom 2: The Plutonia experiment
     - Heretic shareware
     - Heretic registered
     - Hexen
     - Strife shareware
     - Strife
  If you have multiple IWADs, you can use command line params -doom, -doom2,
-tnt, -plutonia, -heretic, -hexen or -strife to look for IWADs only for that
game. Hexen requires wad file from version 1.1. Strife support is just a test.

*****************************************************************************
3. Installation
*****************************************************************************

==============================================================================
3.1 Installing DOS/Windows binaries
==============================================================================

  First choose a directory, where you will place Vavoom - an existing Doom,
Heretic and/or Hexen directory or new directory. If you decide to create a
new directory, you must copy here main game wad file. Then unarchieve here
binaries.

==============================================================================
3.2 Linux/UNIX installation
==============================================================================

In order to compile and run Vavoom under Linux, you need the following:

Compiler and tools:
    * GNU C++ Compiler, GNU make (every LINUX user must have them)
Libraries:
    * zlib
    * libpng
    * Allegro 4.0 (http://alleg.sourceforge.net)
 or
    * SDL 1.2.2 (http://www.libsdl.org)
    * OpenGL: OpenGL implementation from your video card's manufacturer
  or MESA (http://www.mesa3d.org) and X-Windows development libraries.
Optional:
    * OpenAL (http://www.openal.org), the source must be checked out from the
  CVS repository. You will find info on this on OpenAL website or at Creative
  developer center (http://developer.creative.com).

  And of course Vavoom sources.

Step by step:
-------------

  1. Create a new directory 'vavoom' somewhere where you will compile Vavoom
and change into it:

        md vavoom
        cd vavoom

  2. Unpack the Vavoom source package:

        unzip v116_src.zip

  3. If you got zip file then you must run fixunix.sh to convert text files
to UNIX format:

        ./fixunix.sh

  4. If you don't have OpenGL or have problems with compiling OpenGL driver
you can disable it by editing Makefile configuration part.

  If you want to use SDL library, it must be enabled by editing Makefile
configuration part (at the beginning).

  In the same way OpenAL is enabled.

  5. Run make in the main directory.

        make

  This will compile Vavoom executable, utilites, progs and will build
additional wad files.

  6. Then you install it:

        su -c "make install"

  If you don't have ginstall programm, you most likely will have install
programm. In that case use the following command:

        su -c "make INSTALL=install install"

  This will install Vavoom into /usr/local/games/Vavoom.

  7. Change to this directory and copy the main .wad file here or create
a symbolic link to it:

        cd /usr/local/games/Vavoom
        cp <where-your-wad-file-is> .
   or:
        cd /usr/local/games/Vavoom
        ln -s <where-your-wad-file-is> .

  Also make sure that the file/symbolic link name is in lower case.

  8. Run Allegro setup utility, setup your sound and music card, save changes
and then copy allegro.cfg into Vavoom directory.

==============================================================================
3.3 Compiling LINUX / UNIX dedicated server
==============================================================================

Compiler and tools:
    * GNU C++ Compiler, GNU make

  First run fixunix.sh to convert text files to UNIX format:

        ./fixunix.sh

  Then you compile it:

        make sv

  Then you install it:

        su -c "make installsv"

==============================================================================
3.4 Other source code compiling information for developers
==============================================================================

For DOS you need
  Compiler and tools:
      * DJGPP (http://www.delorie.com/djgpp)
      * GNU make or RHIDE
  Libraries:
      * zlib
      * libpng
      * Allegro 4.0 (http://alleg.sourceforge.net) and later.
      * OpenGL version: MESA (http://www.mesa3d.org) and Allegro driver for
    MESA (http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/7259/)

For Windows you need:
  Compiler and tools:
      * Borland C Compiler with Borland Turbo Assembler or Borland C++
    Builder 5.0 (http://www.borland.com) Compiler itself is freeware, but I
    don't know how about TASM.
  or:
      * Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0.
      * DJGPP (http://www.delorie.com/djgpp) - used to compile asm files.
  Libraries:
      * zlib
      * libpng
      * DirectX 7 SDK (http://www.microsoft.com/directx), already included
    in Builder but some headers needed by DirectMusic are missing. In Allogro
    website (http://alleg.sourceforge.net) you will find a minimal version of
    DirectX 7 SDK.
      * EAX 2.0 SDK (http://developer.creative.com/).
      * OpenAL SDK (http://developer.creative.com), you must create directory
    AL in your compier's include directory and copy OpenAL include files here.

  The Makefile-s are for DOS and LINUX, for Windows the makefiles are files
with extension .mak. For DOS there's also RHIDE project files, for Windows
there's also Builder project files.
  You can also compile with MSVC, you will find workspace and project files
in subdirectory 'msvc'.

*****************************************************************************
4. Starting a net game
*****************************************************************************

  First about drivers. DOS version supports IPX, Beame & Whiteside TCP/IP and
MPATH TCP/IP drivers. MPATH driver needs a launcher, the one from Quake works
fine (because the drivers are taken from Quake sources). Serial driver is not
fixed (if you need this, please let me know or otherwise I will not fix it).
Windows version supports Winsock TCP/IP and Winsock IPX driers. Linux version
haves only TCP/IP driver.

  The default socket port is 26000. It can be changed in console with command
"port <port>".

  Now network game can be launched from menu. It's Quake-like, so you should
not have problems with it.

  Here is a list of most important server console variables and commands for
dedicated server operators.

Server console variables:
-------------------------

    DeathMatch          - 0 - cooperative, other - deathmatch, in Doom
                            1 - like was param -deathmatch
                            2 - like was -altdeath - items and weapons are
                          respawning
                            3 - like 2, but monsters are respawning very fast
                          and they are attacking each other - total nightmare
    NoMonsters          - 0 - enable, 1 - disable monsters;
    TimeLimit           - Replaces command line param -time, sets time (in
                     minutes), after which level will automaticly end, 0 for
                     no limit, works only in deathmatch.
    HostName            - Name, listed in server list and that can be used to
                     connect to this server.
    Skill               - Game skill, 0 - very easy, 4 - nightmare

Server console commands:
------------------------

    MaxPlayers [<players>]

  Changes maximal mumber of players. Can be executed only when server is not
running, for dedicated servers only on command line.

    Map <mapname>

  Shuts down current server and spawns a new one in specified map. As you
understand all clients are dropped.

*****************************************************************************
5. Command line parameters
*****************************************************************************

  All console commands can be specified at command line by prefixing them
with symbol +, they will be executed after executing basev/startup.vs.

7. Version history
*****************************************************************************

==============================================================================
Version 1.1
==============================================================================

* Replaced immediate console command execution with command buffer (like in
 Quake).
* Replaced old message with 5 notify messages.
* Created switches script.
* All games can have extended level structure with ACS scripts.
* Reworked all sound, music and CD-audio stuff.
* Created new sound script with more info than SNDINFO, this one replaces
 builtin table of sounds.
* Fixed problem with long sound lumps.
* Added function S_PlayTillDone for Doom quit sounds.
* Windows version now suports 3D sound (if Your hardware suports it).
* No more builtin sound sequence list - now registering all sequences from
 script.
* CD now works on Windows and also on Linux (thanks to sources if Quake).
* Some other bugfixes and improvements.

==============================================================================
Version 1.2
==============================================================================

* Some structures are replaced with C++ classes, which makes coding easier.
* Functions, that takes most of the execution time (R_DrawColumn, R_DrawSpan
 and RunFunction) now are in assembler (DOS and LINUX versions only).
* Improved dehacked support. Now it handles everything, that it can. It is
 also added to makeinfo utility, which means that now you can create PROGS
 with changes of dehacked patch.
* Removed some command line params (-playdemo, -record, -width, -height, ..).
 Moust of them are replaced with console commands that can be specified in
 command line by adding + before them (like in Quake).
* Some bug fixes.

==============================================================================
Version 1.3
==============================================================================

* DOS network drivers ported to DJGPP and moved into main executable.
* Fixed chat.
* Fixed multiplayer intermission.
* Totaly rewrote network protocol. Added multicast server. This means that
 all client messages are sent only to server and server forwards them to
 other players. Why that's for? Whel, in the begining, when I tried to run
 4 players on IPX, it seemed that it runs one tic per second. By adding
 -extratics situation got a little bit better, but not by much. Now 4 players
 on IPX realy can play. No need to use -dup option so I decided to remove it.
 -extratics option was removed, when I added ACK mechanism.

==============================================================================
Version 1.4 BETA
==============================================================================

 in executable some drawing functions still use them because conversation from
 float to int is very expensive.
* Fixed bug with framerate bigger than 35 FPS (caused delays between input
 and actual action)
* Improoved Windows keyboard input
* I hope that I fixed problem with sound in Windows version
* Added screen resolution menu

    extern int TextureNumForName(string name);
    extern int CheckFlatNumForName(string name);
    extern int FlatNumForName(string name);

  If texture or flat is not found, Check... functions returns -1, but
 functions without Check will abort programm with error message.

==============================================================================
Version 1.666 BETA 2
==============================================================================

* Disabled testing of lighting effects, in Hexen MAP01 it took 62% of
 execution time.

* Removed support for C-style type casting, use dynamic cast instead.
* New type - name: The name of an item in Vavoom (such as the name of a
 function, state, class, etc). Names are stored as a 16-bit index into the
 global name table.
* New type - bool. It's implemented as a bitfield. That means that in structs
 and classes a list of sequential bool properties will be merged into a single
 32 bit integer so it's a good idea to group them together.
* Changed states syntax. Function pointer replaced with state code.
* Some other changes.
