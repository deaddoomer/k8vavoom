as the final maulotaur bellows his
death-agony, you realize that you
have never come so close to your own
destruction. not even the fight with
d'sparil and his disciples had been
this desperate. grimly you stare at
the gates which open before you,
wondering if they lead home, or if
they open onto some undreamed-of
horror. you find yourself wondering
if you have the strength to go on,
if nothing but death and pain await
you. but what else can you do, if
the will to fight is gone? can you
force yourself to continue in the
face of such despair? do you have
the courage? you find, in the end,
that it is not within you to
surrender without a fight. eyes
wide, you go to meet your fate.
