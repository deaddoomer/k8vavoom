with the destruction of the iron
liches and their minions, the last
of the undead are cleared from this
plane of existence.

those creatures had to come from
somewhere, though, and you have the
sneaky suspicion that the fiery
portal of hell's maw opens onto
their home dimension.

to make sure that more undead
(or even worse things) don't come
through, you'll have to seal hell's
maw from the other side. of course
this means you may get stuck in a
very unfriendly world, but no one
ever said being a Heretic was easy!
