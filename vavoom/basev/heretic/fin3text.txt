the death of d'sparil has loosed
the magical bonds holding his
creatures on this plane, their
dying screams overwhelming his own
cries of agony.

your oath of vengeance fulfilled,
you enter the portal to your own
world, mere moments before the dome
shatters into a million pieces.

but if d'sparil's power is broken
forever, why don't you feel safe?
was it that last shout just before
his death, the one that sounded
like a curse? or a summoning? you
can't really be sure, but it might
just have been a scream.

then again, what about the other
serpent riders?
