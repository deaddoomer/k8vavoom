the mighty maulotaurs have proved
to be no match for you, and as
their steaming corpses slide to the
ground you feel a sense of grim
satisfaction that they have been
destroyed.

the gateways which they guarded
have opened, revealing what you
hope is the way home. but as you
step through, mocking laughter
rings in your ears.

was some other force controlling
the maulotaurs? could there be even
more horrific beings through this
gate? the sweep of a crystal dome
overhead where the sky should be is
certainly not a good sign....
