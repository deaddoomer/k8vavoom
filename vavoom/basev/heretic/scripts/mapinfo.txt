exittext "with the destruction of the iron
liches and their minions, the last
of the undead are cleared from this
plane of existence.

those creatures had to come from
somewhere, though, and you have the
sneaky suspicion that the fiery
portal of hell's maw opens onto
their home dimension.

to make sure that more undead
(or even worse things) don't come
through, you'll have to seal hell's
maw from the other side. of course
this means you may get stuck in a
very unfriendly world, but no one
ever said being a Heretic was easy!"

exittext "the mighty maulotaurs have proved
to be no match for you, and as
their steaming corpses slide to the
ground you feel a sense of grim
satisfaction that they have been
destroyed.

the gateways which they guarded
have opened, revealing what you
hope is the way home. but as you
step through, mocking laughter
rings in your ears.

was some other force controlling
the maulotaurs? could there be even
more horrific beings through this
gate? the sweep of a crystal dome
overhead where the sky should be is
certainly not a good sign...."

exittext "the death of d'sparil has loosed
the magical bonds holding his
creatures on this plane, their
dying screams overwhelming his own
cries of agony.

your oath of vengeance fulfilled,
you enter the portal to your own
world, mere moments before the dome
shatters into a million pieces.

but if d'sparil's power is broken
forever, why don't you feel safe?
was it that last shout just before
his death, the one that sounded
like a curse? or a summoning? you
can't really be sure, but it might
just have been a scream.

then again, what about the other
serpent riders?"

exittext "you thought you would return to your
own world after d'sparil died, but
his final act banished you to his
own plane. here you entered the
shattered remnants of lands
conquered by d'sparil. you defeated
the last guardians of these lands,
but now you stand before the gates
to d'sparil's stronghold. until this
moment you had no doubts about your
ability to face anything you might
encounter, but beyond this portal
lies the very heart of the evil
which invaded your world. d'sparil
might be dead, but the pit where he
was spawned remains. now you must
enter that pit in the hopes of
finding a way out. and somewhere,
in the darkest corner of d'sparil's
demesne, his personal bodyguards
await your arrival ..."

exittext "as the final maulotaur bellows his
death-agony, you realize that you
have never come so close to your own
destruction. not even the fight with
d'sparil and his disciples had been
this desperate. grimly you stare at
the gates which open before you,
wondering if they lead home, or if
they open onto some undreamed-of
horror. you find yourself wondering
if you have the strength to go on,
if nothing but death and pain await
you. but what else can you do, if
the will to fight is gone? can you
force yourself to continue in the
face of such despair? do you have
the courage? you find, in the end,
that it is not within you to
surrender without a fight. eyes
wide, you go to meet your fate."
