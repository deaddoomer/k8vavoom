CHANGELOG
=========

Changes in V1.95  (24th September 2001)
---------------------------------------

 - new GUI version using the FLTK toolkit.
 
 - many fixes for Hexen wads, thanks to Janis Legzdinsh, including
   auto-detection of a hexen wad (don't need -hexen option).

 - level names (MAP01, E2M3, etc) are detected automatically now,
   allowing arbitrary names (e.g. RUINS, QD05, etc).
 
 - improved wad.c to return error values instead of doing
   FatalError(), setting up the comms->message appropriately.
 
 - removed `display_setText' function from nodebuildfuncs API.

 - fixed the memory semantics for the glbsp API, with new functions
   GlbspStrDup() and GlbspFree().
 
 - documented the nodebuildfuncs in glbsp.h.

 - improved the semantics of the GlbspCheckInfo() function, adding a
   new error code GLBSP_E_BadInfoFixed to show that (a) there was a
   problem but (b) the parameter causing it has been reset.


Changes in V1.94  (6th June 2001)
---------------------------------

 - shows percentage while loading and saving.
 - shows warnings when results overflow normal DOOM limits.
 - shows warnings for extremely long linedefs and nodes.
 - fixed serious bug with blockmap truncation code.
 - new -maxblock option gives control over blockmap truncation.
 - fixed some build problems with very narrow subsectors.
 - fixed warnings about 2s linedefs with no left side.
 - new "slightly better than nothing" reject support.
 - code is much more modular: UI has been separated out.
 - improved debugging code.


Changes in V1.91  (10th September 2000)
---------------------------------------

 - optimised, DOOM2.WAD: 50% faster, ETERNAL.WAD: 3 times faster.
 - builds "V2 GL Nodes" which are more accurate.
 - no longer balks at bad sidedefs (with sector of #-1).
 - removes unused sectors & sidedefs.
 - packs the blockmap, and can pack identical sidedefs.
 - shows the percentage complete while building.
 - floatified: nodes are computed using high precision math.
 - source code is now under the GNU General Public License.


Changes in V1.8  (20th June 2000)
---------------------------------

 - fixed major bug causing thin (but ugly looking) gaps to appear
   between some subsectors.

 - fixed some bugs with partner segs not being split properly.

 - fixed crashing bug when splitting very short segs.
