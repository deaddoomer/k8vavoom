Compiling glBSP
===============

by Andrew Apted.  7th June 2000.


glBSP has been written with portability in mind.  It is purely ANSI C,
with one minor exception: I use // comments instead of the more
traditional /* */ comments.

glBSP has been known to compile and work on the following platforms:

   +  Linux 2.1.126, libc5, GCC 2.7.2.1 and GNU make.

   +  MSDOS 6.22, with DJGPP 2.02.

   +  Win32, with Borland C++Builder 5.5.


Linux
-----

The "makefile" makefile is the correct one for Linux and other UN*X
type OSes.  Simply typing `make' should create the `glbsp' executable.
Currently there is no automatic installation, just copy the glbsp
executable to where you want it.


MSDOS
-----

The "makefile.dj" makefile is for compiling under DOS with DJGPP.  Simply
typing `make -f makefile.dj' should create the `glbsp.exe' executable.


Win32
-----

The "makefile.bcc" makefile is for compiling under Win32 with Borland
C++Builder 5.5.  Assuming BCC is configured properly (the ".cfg" files
it needs have been setup), typing `make -f makefile.bcc' should create
the `glbsp.exe' executable.  Note that glBSP under Win32 is a console
application and should be run from a DOS box.
