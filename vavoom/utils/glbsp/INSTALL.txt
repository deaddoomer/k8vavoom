Compiling glBSP
===============

by Andrew Apted.  Last updated: 8th June 2001.


glBSP has been written with portability in mind.  It is purely ANSI C,
with one minor exception: I use // comments instead of the more
traditional /* */ comments.

glBSP has been known to compile and work on the following platforms:

   +  Linux 2.1.126, libc5, GCC 2.7.2.1.

   +  Linux 2.2.18, glibc 2.2, GCC 2.95.2.

   +  MSDOS 6.22, with DJGPP 2.02.

   +  Win32, with Borland C++Builder 5.5.


Linux
-----

CD into the cmdline directory.  The "makefile" makefile is the correct
one for Linux and other UN*X type OSes.  Simply typing `make' should
create the `glbsp' executable.  Currently there is no automatic
installation, just copy the glbsp executable to where you want it.


MSDOS
-----

CD into the cmdline directory.  The "makefile.dj" makefile is for
compiling under DOS with DJGPP.  Simply typing `make -f makefile.dj'
should create the glbsp.exe executable.


Win32
-----

CD into the cmdline directory.  The "makefile.bcc" makefile is for
compiling under Win32 with Borland C++Builder 5.5.  Assuming BCC is
configured properly (the ".cfg" files it needs have been setup),
typing `make -f makefile.bcc' should create the glbsp.exe executable.


Plugin
------

The plugin version of glBSP is a special version that can be used
within other programs, e.g. a DOOM engine.  Instructions for making
the plugin are similiar to the above, but CD into the `plugin'
directory instead.  The result is a library file: libglbsp.a under
Linux and MSDOS, libglbsp.lib under Win32.

NOTE: since glBSP is under the GNU General Public License (GPL), it
can only be incorporated into other programs that are also under the
GPL.  See the file COPYING.txt for the full details.
