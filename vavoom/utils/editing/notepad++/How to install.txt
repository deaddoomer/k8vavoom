This will make it easier to work with VavoomC using Notepad++.

If you don't have NotePad++, you can find it here: http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/

Once you download and install it, follow these instructions to make it work:

If you don't have any userDefineLang.xml file under the directory where you installed Notepadd++
(where the .exe file is located), then simply paste this file there, if you have this file then open this XML
file, copy it's contents and paste them on the one in this directory, NP++ will read your VC files and highlight
the syntax on them!!

For the functions list rules, first make sure that you have the Function List plugin installed, if you don't,
check Notepad++ documentation on how to this, once it's installed, you'll need to open FunctionListRules.xml
in your "plugin/config" directory where NotePad++ is installed, then paste the contents of the file between
<FunctionList> and </FunctionList> on the lowest part of FunctionListRules.xml, NP++ will list your VC functions
the next time you open the program!!
