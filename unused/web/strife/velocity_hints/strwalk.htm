Following is an honest to goodness walk-through guide for the STRIFE teaser, and many of the more problematic missions in the Retail version of Strife.  If you are stuck, this should help.  If you can't get past the Governor, skip down to the good stuff (after the spoiler alert) and read on if you dare.  Intrigue and  mystery abounds in STRIFE, so get used to plot twists, and remember, TRUST NO ONE.

	<LI><A HREF="powwalk.htm"><B>Power Station</B></A> - Spies to find, people to meet then kill, a suicide run, and a big crystal to blow up.  Whew.</LI>
	<LI><A HREF="sewwalk.htm"><B>Sewers</B></A> - Apparently we did our job well.  We wanted you to get confused, and judging from the email, everyone is knee-deep in green slime, squeaking rats and leprous beggars.</LI>
	<LI><A HREF="maulwalk.htm"><B>Where to find the Mauler</B></A> - It's our favorite weapon too, but we wanted you to earn it, so we hid it well. It's high time you were able to disintegrate a few acolytes, eh?</LI>
	<LI><A HREF="bishwalk.htm"><B>Defeating the Bishop</B></A> - A little finesse is all it takes, not to mention having a little inside info.</LI>
	<LI><A HREF="richwalk.htm"><B>Where's that Richter?</B></A> - Everyone wants to know, and he's getting impatient.  So here you go.</LI>
	<LI><A HREF="provwalk.htm"><B>The Proving Grounds</B></A> - Get ready, this one is complex.</LI>

That's all we've got for now.  As time goes on, we'll be adding to the list so drop us a line and let us know what you think will help!
