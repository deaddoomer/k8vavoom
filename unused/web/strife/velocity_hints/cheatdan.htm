	<DT><I>Weapons</I> (BOOMSTIX)</DT>
 	<DD>If you already have one or more sigil pieces and you use the weapons cheat, your pieces will disappear.  Permanently.  We're not sure why this happens, but be aware of it. SOLUTION: Don't use the cheat after you kill the Programmer.  OR, only use this cheat to play with the weapons, not to complete the game.  OR, use the SIGIL cheat (which hasn't been released yet) to get your pieces back.</DD>
<P>
	<DT><I>Invulnerability</I> (OMNIPOTENT)</DT>
	<DD>If you fall into an instant-death pit, you won't die, and you probably can't get out.  Also, you can still be killed by "tele-fragging" (someone teleports on top of you = instant death). SOLUTION: Type it again to turn off and die, then hit space bar to start at the beginning of that level (or reload your saved game if you prefer). </DD>
<P>
	<DT><I>All Keys</I> (JIMMY)</DT>
	<DD>Getting into areas you normally can't can screw up the story. Using this cheat repeatedly can erase ALL your keys. SOLUTION: Don't use this cheat unless you are just goofing off. Type repeatedly to cycle through some, all or no keys.</DD>
<P>
	<DT><I>Gold</I> (DONNYTRUMP)</DT>
	<DD>This cheat will also give you stat tokens that can clutter your inventory.  BTW, the amount of gold you get goes up based on your stats. SOLUTION: If you want to cheat for stat increases, you can redeem the tokens.  Otherwise, they will sit in your inventory until you drop them or finish the game.</DD>
<P>
	<DT><I>Power Ups</I> (PUMPUP)</DT>
	<DD>These are pretty harmless for the most part. STATS is a permanent increase - you can't bring them back down.  Also, your stats can't go above 100, even if you have stat tokens.</DD>
