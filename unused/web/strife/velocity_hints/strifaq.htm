	<DT><A NAME="one"><B>Q:  Where's Richter, that guy by the waterfall?</B></A></DT></BR>
	<DD>A:	Richter is in the Order Commons.   See the accompanying <A HREF="richwalk.htm">walkthrough</A> for directions.</DD>
<P>
	<DT><A NAME="two"><B>Q:  What’s the Teaser?  What’s the Retail?  What version do I have?</B></A></DT><BR>
	<DD>A:	The teaser is our "shareware" version of Strife- it contains 3 complete levels, 4 weapons, and several major characters.  It even has it’s own little mission to complete- capture the Order’s Chalice to gain access to the Front, a rebel group that pays mercenaries like yourself (see the accompanying walkthrough for a complete tour of the Teaser).<BR><BR>
		The Retail version is our "full" version of Strife.  It is available in stores, not as an add-on patch (although you can order it by phone if you want). Strife retails for $49.95, but you may be able to buy it for less at some of the cheaper distributors.  It has been released on CD-ROM.  Strife (the full retail version)  should be available at the following stores/distributors NOW (ask them if you don't see it):
		ABCO, Babbage's, Best Buy, Circuit City, Comp USA, Computer City, Egghead Software, Electronic Botique, Fred Meyer, Fry's electronics, Incredible Universe, Multimicro, Musicland, Office Depot., Price Costco, Software Etc., 3D Micro, and The Virgin Megastore.<BR><BR>
		Or, you can purchase a copy from Velocity, Inc. by calling this number:  1-800-856-2489.</DD>
<P>
	<DT><A NAME="three"><B>Q: What’s up with the Governor?  I seem to be stuck.</B></A></DT><BR>
	<DD>A: In the Teaser, you aren’t supposed to trust Harris, the guy who sends you to the governor.  Kill Harris instead (after grabbing the chalice).  In the Retail, don’t even _touch_ the chalice until after you have gotten your prison pass from the governor- otherwise, he’ll be totally uncooperative (and you will be stuck.).</DD>
<P>
	<DT><A NAME="four"><B>Q: How do I kill the Bishop?</B></A></DT><BR>
	<DD>A: The Specter that comes out of the Bishop (the blobby thing) cannot be harmed by normal weapons.  You have to use the Sigil to take it out.  For more help on beating the Bishop, see the accompanying <A HREF="bishwalk.htm">walkthrough</A>.</DD>
<P>
	<DT><A NAME="five"><B>Q: Why no Coop mode?</B></A></DT><BR>
	<DD>A:	DOOM had the decisive (dis)advantage of linear level layouts, no dialogue interface, no mission log, etc.  making it easy to implement coop mode.  Unfortunately, making all the new features for Strife work in multiplayer would mean the game would be out some time next decade...<BR><BR>
        We highly recommend turning monsters on in deathmatch, and trying to get through the levels with a friend.  It's not much different from coop in Doom. In fact, one of the cool features in Strife multiplayer that Doom doesn't have is that you can give stuff to each other!  Just drop an item from your inventory (use backspace), and your buddy can pick it up!  Also, up to 8 players can get involved (perfect for the higher difficulty levels).<BR><BR>
	Nothing will stop you from playing cooperatively in Deathmatch (don't forget that on TRAINING difficulty, you can check out the other player's view (press F12).  For the ultimate challenge in the Retail Version, see if you can get to the Programmer on Bloodbath difficulty setting!  (It can't be done with only 1 player- the Crusaders regenerate too fast).</DD>
<P>
	<DT><A NAME="six"><B>Q: Why is there only one save slot per game?</B></A></DT><BR>
	<DD>A:	We knew that multiple saves were something everyone wanted.  But Strife's save games were more complex than Doom's,  and it would have been difficult to implement multiple saves in a satisfactory manner, so it didn't get done before the game had to be released.  The overwhelming demand for multiple saves will not go unnoticed in future products!
	If you have saved your game after doing something you didn’t want to do, here’s something you can try:  by dying and pressing spacebar, you’ll reload your game from the last area transition.   Try loading your offending saved game, killing yourself  and then pressing spacebar.   As long as you didn’t leave the area you made the error in before saving your game, you can undo the damage.</DD>
<P>
	<DT><A NAME="seven"><B>Q: Is there a level editor for Strife?</B></A></DT><BR>
	<DD>A:	Sort of.  So far, the best support for Strife we’ve seen is by the DeeP editor (which supports the Teaser version of Strife).  	 DeeP can be obtained from the following nice people:

	<DT><A NAME="eight"><B>Q: When will Strife be available outside North America?</DT></B></A><BR>
	<DD>A:	3DO has purchased the rights to Strife for international sales, and should be selling copies soon. Thanks for being patient!  </DD>
