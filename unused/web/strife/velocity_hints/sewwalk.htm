<B>Snagging the Grenade Launcher:</B>
<P>
First, make sure you have some Environmental suits (you can find some in the Power Station, or buy them from the Armorer in the Shops).  Then, head along the river past the town hall.  There’s a switch on a little column near the peasant who is "guarding" the sewers.  Throw the switch and go into the area it opened  up.  Throw the switch on the wall in there, and drop down the hole into the sewers.
<P>
You’ll land in some green muck flowing downstream.  Turn around and check the wall behind you for a secret.  Then, head downstream, shoot the Sentinel, and get out to the left before you plunge over the edge.  Take the lift down,  and run across the sludge to the platform on the other side.  Go up the curving staircase, and kill both guards at the top.  Be sure to grab the ID that one of them drops, and throw the switch on the wall of the upper section.  There’s some loot back there too.  Then, head back down the curving staircase. 
<P> 
Two passages will now be open.  Put on an Environmental suit, and take the passage on the left.  When it opens up into a room, turn left and go up the stairs that curve up to the right.  Shoot any Stalkers and Sentinels that bother you.  When you get to the top of the stairs,  go through the door on the right, then open the next door on your right.  Inside there are some more goodies, as well as the GRENADE LAUNCHER.  Exit,  go back down the curving stairs(Left), and back down the passage (Right).
<P>
<B>Locating Weran, the Rat King:</B>
<P>
Now you want to take the passage on the Right.  Stay to the right, and jump up the big steps.  You’ll get to two little rooms, one straight ahead and one to your right.  Each has a Sentinel in it (shoot them) and each has a small grating door.  Take the one straight ahead.  Inside is a lift that will take you  up.    When you get to the top, watch for Stalkers, and go straight ahead.  You’ll see a door and a window- take the door into the guard room and kill the guard, then throw the switch in there.  Go back out and turn right- you should see some cave walls opened up.  Watch for a Sentinel on your right, then head into the cave area and stick to your right.  Keep going right until you see some beggars.   Walk past them and you should see a grey stone area.  Head inside, go up the steps, and turn left to meet WERAN.  He’ll tell you to get a guard uniform and open a door to the town.  Grab some loot.
<P>
<B>Procuring the Uniform:</B>
<P>
Exit WERAN’s den, and stick to the left of the cave areas to get back the way you came in.  When you get to the lift, go down, out through the door, and turn left towards the other door.  Open it and take the lift  there.  When you get to the top, watch for stalkers, and follow the hallway.  When it turns right, throw the switch on the wall and shoot the Sentinels.  Then continue down the hallway past the window, down the steps, and open the gate there.  Then turn right and go across the bridge.  You’ll see a room on the other side- watch for stalkers, and go up the stairway in the back.  You’ll transition to the TOWN area.
<P>
Kill the guard there and grab the uniform he drops.  You can go out to the town if you want to stock up on supplies.  Then, go back the way you came to get back into the Sewers.  Follow your map and retrace your steps to get to Weran, and he’ll tell you how to get to the Gate controls.  He’ll also give you some flamethrower parts.  If you want, you can go back to the town and exchange the parts for a flamethrower  (see Irale, in the room next to the Weapons shop).   Either way, start at WERAN’s place to get to the gate controls.
<P>
<B>Finding the Gate Controls:</B>
<P>
Exit Weran’s place and go straight ahead.  You’ll see a descending staircase in the caves ahead (one of the TUNNELS OPENED BY WERAN).  Go down the stairs, then cut across to the little platform on the other side of the sludge.  Go up the tiny stairs to get to the upper section of the sludge.  Shoot the 4 sentinels hiding in the alcoves and grab the ammo.  When the hallway widens out, turn left and open the door to the Guard Shack.  Kill the guard inside and throw the switch.  Go back out and turn left, and go up the staircase.  You’ll transition to an isolated part of the CASTLE area(note: this does not connect easily to the rest of the Castle, so don’t bother trying to get to the rest of the castle from the sewers!).
<P>
Go up the stairs, turn right, and run straight past the platform (you can kill the guard there if you want).  Take the lift up, and you’ll be outside.  Watch for Stalkers, and take the stairs down to your right.  Go into the little room inside and throw the switch.  Then, go out and back up the stairs,  and through the large opening into the Reclamation tank area (not the area with the force field).  The reclamation Tank  looks like two large connected pools.  Go to the right and turn the crank.  Jump into the tank and ride it down as it drains, and be sure to put on an environmental suit. 
<P>
When you get to the bottom of the RECLAMATION TANK, go through the left doorway (dark).  You’ll transition back into the sewers area.  Drop down into the large open area and watch for stalkers.  To your left you’ll see a short hallway with a door on one side, but you can’t get to the door because there’s a big PIT there.  Turn left and go down the long, narrow hallway.  It turns to the left, then goes over a CROSSOVER.  Then it goes down some steps, turns left again, then left again.  On your right you’ll see a large door- open it, and go inside.  Watch for Stalkers, and head to the back of the room past the three pipes, in a little alcove.  Turn the crank in there- that raises the water level in that pit near the beginning of this section of the sewers.  There’s  a stash of goodies nearby the peasant in this area, by the way…  Now, you’ll want to go out the big door, and turn LEFT so that you are backtracking the way you came (turning right each time) until you get back to the large open area.  Now turn left, and you can walk over to the door in the little hallway there because the PIT will be filled with  sludge.  Inside, you’ll see four columns of machinery (one of which has a SECRET)  guarded by some Sentinels, and a little door on your right.  Open the door and jump up onto the ledge, then turn left and go until you get to a lift.  Take the lift up, and right ahead is the GATE CONTROL Mechanism.  Destroy it (you can even punch it if you want), then go across to another lift that will take you back down.  Congratulations, now the Front can assault the Castle from the town because the Castle’s main gate will be open!
<P>
<B>Getting Out of the Sewers Alive:</B>
<P>
Now you have to get out.  Exit the control room,  and turn right  to go down the long CROSSOVER hallway again.  This time, follow the long hallway ALL the way around.  Push the button to lower the bridge in the middle of the CROSSOVER section and keep going.  Watch for Sentinels.  When you get to a big door, open it, watch out for a stalker, and go straight ahead.  Ignore the two little doors on either side- go up the stairs until the hallway opens up.  Watch for Stalkers on your left, and grab the med patches there.  Then, go right into the little guard room again.  Open the little door in there and take the TELEPORTER.
<P>
You’ll come out near the little lifts near the beginning. Make a sharp right to go down the little hallway and onto the lift, and take it down.  (This part should be familiar, it’s how you get to the guard uniform, and it’s the ONLY way out of the sewers). Then go out through the door, and turn left towards the other door.  Open it and take the lift  there.  When you get to the top, watch for stalkers, and follow the hallway.  When it turns right, continue down the hallway past the window, down the steps, and through the gate.  Then turn right and go across the bridge.  You’ll see a room on the other side-  go up the stairway in the back.  You’ll transition to the TOWN area.  Go out the door, and you’re free!  Be sure to get your flamethrower from Irale if you haven’t already, and head back to the Front Base where Macil will give you gold, training tokens, and a briefing on the Castle.   After getting geared up and seeing the Medic and Weapons trainer, head across the river in town, up the steps past the tavern, and through the Main Gate into the Castle!
