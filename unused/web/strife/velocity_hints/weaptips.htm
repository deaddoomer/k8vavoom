	<IMG SRC="Punch.gif" ALIGN=LEFT ALT="The Punch Dagger"><FONT SIZE=6><B>The Punch Dagger</B></FONT> won’t set off alarms (although if a guard is watching closely he’ll see you and go after you).  The damage your punch does will go up along with your stats!    If you hold down the attack key (the default is [Ctrl] if you didn’t remap it), you’ll swing fast and regular, and you’ll move forward slightly each time you hit, keeping you close to your target.

	<IMG SRC="Crossbow.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="The Crossbow"><FONT SIZE=6><B>The Crossbow</B></FONT> loaded with electric arrows is good if you don’t want to waste ammo on your better weapons (for example, shooting a Stalker that can’t get to you).  The Poison arrows are excellent for speedily and silently dispatching Acolytes.  You can even use them on Harris or the Governor to avoid alarms!  Remember that poison arrows don’t do damage to non-living targets, so don’t waste them.

	<IMG SRC="Assault.gif" ALIGN=LEFT ALT="The Assault Gun"><FONT SIZE=6><B>The Assault Gun</B></FONT>  Until your accuracy improves, you’ll want to just tap the fire button instead of holding it down.  Firing short bursts keeps your bullets on target.  The assault gun also does a little bit of stun, so if you can keep a steady stream of bullets on your target, they may not be able to get a shot off (Sentinels are very susceptible to this tactic).  You’ll want to buy an ammo satchel before going into the prison, just so you can carry out all the ammo you’ll find in there!  The Assault gun’s shots are much less likely to "catch" on wall or window edges than missiles or electric bolts, so use it if you need to fire through tight gaps or between bars.

	<IMG SRC="Missilel.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="The Missile Launcher"><FONT SIZE=6><B>The Missile Launcher</B></FONT> has incredible range, but it’s hard to hit a target consistently.  If you like to pop out from behind walls and snipe targets, this is the weapon of choice (other than the Mauler perhaps).  It’s an excellent weapon for taking out turrets, providing you hit.   If you’re a good shot, you can quickly take out targets like Acolytes and Stalkers at long range.  Be careful not to fire too close to a wall or your target- the explosion can do damage to you too.

	<IMG SRC="Flamethr.gif" ALIGN=LEFT ALT="The Flamethrower"><FONT SIZE=6><B>The Flamethrower</B></FONT> is limited in range, but this is a powerful and versatile weapon!  Like the Assault gun, the Flamethrower does some stun, and is great for taking out Sentinels,  Reavers, Crusaders, Templars- darn near every enemy in the game (even turrets and Stalkers if they’re low enough).  You can fire a nice arc over walls and into windows if you aim carefully.  Be careful when flaming Acolytes- if they touch you when they’re burning, you can take damage.

	<IMG SRC="Grenadel.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="The Grenade Launcher"><FONT SIZE=6><B>The Grenade Launcher</B></FONT> is one of the most powerful and most dangerous weapons in the game.  It takes a lot of practice to get grenades to go where you want (instead of bouncing back in your lap).  But once you master it, it is a deadly weapon.  The trick is to line up the right barrel, then press the fire button, then turn a little to bring the left barrel in line before it fires.  (Sorry, there’s no way to fire just one grenade- typical of the Order’s technology).  If you get it right, you can get both grenades to fire at the same spot, causing loads of mayhem.   Don’t forget trajectories- you can adjust how far (or high) your grenades fire by aiming up or down with the [PgUp] and [PgDn] keys.  After a bit of practice, you’ll be lobbing grenades through windows and onto walkways!  If your grenade bounces back at you, be sure to get the heck out of the way.  The Incendiary grenades can be particularly effective since they 	burn for a while.  If you have to take out a lot of enemies, try to lure them towards you through a tight spot (like a small room, hallway,  or doorway, also known as a "choke point") and fire an incendiary in the choke point.  The enemies aren’t too bright, and you can lure them right into the flames!  Even Crusaders can be neatly dispatched with this technique if you find a good choke point.  If you need to be close to the flames, put on an environmental suit.  You won’t take any damage from the flames while the suit lasts, but the fire will block your movement and push you around a little.  Flames can climb up or drip down short heights, so be careful when firing them onto ledges or stairs.

	<IMG SRC="Mauler.gif" ALIGN=LEFT ALT="The Mauler"><FONT SIZE=6><B>The Mauler</B></FONT> is a pretty cool weapon, but it uses beaucoup energy, so you may be better off using the Flamer if you are engaging small or close targets.  The Scatter mode takes a short while to recharge, so it’s best used if you only need one shot to take the target out (like a Sentinel or Reaver).  Get in close if you want to make sure all the little pellets hit, doing maximum damage.  The Torpedo mode will actually do a bit of damage to you when you fire it, and it takes time to get the shot off, so it’s best reserved for large targets or tight clumps of distant targets.   Against large targets, make sure you hit dead center for maximum impact.  Like the Assault gun, the Scatter mode doesn’t get caught on edges, so it’s not a bad weapon for shooting through grates and such.
