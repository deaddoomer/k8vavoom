<TR>
	<TH>Acolyte<BR><IMG SRC="Acolyte.gif"></TH>
	<TD><A NAME="acolyte">Acolytes</A> are pretty slow, and susceptible to all weapon types.  As long as you keep moving or you take them out quickly, they shouldn’t give you too much grief.  They have cool death sequences for fire weapons (Incendiary grenades, Flamethrower) and for the Mauler!  But if you need to conserve ammo, use poison arrows or the Assault gun.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TH>Turret<BR><IMG SRC="Turret.gif"></TH>
	<TD><A NAME="turret">They</A> obey alarms, so you don’t have to worry about them until an alarm goes off (of course, firing weapons will set off the alarms).  Stay out of line of sight or keep moving to avoid getting shot. One good missile hit can take them out.   If you’re good, you can run toward them and fire a missile without them even hitting you.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TH>Stalker<BR><IMG SRC="Stalker.gif"></TH>
	<TD><A NAME="stalker">They’re</A> very good at sneaking up on you.  Keep an ear out for them- they make a distinctive sound when they first spot you, and you can usually hear them coming.  They usually start attached to the ceiling.  If there’s a lip (doorframe, roof beam, etc.) on the ceiling, stand behind it- they usually stop when they hit something.    "Draw" them out by darting under them and ducking back before they land on you, then blast them with the Assault gun or Flamethrower.    For low ceilings, you can burn them out with the Flamethrower.  If you run out of ammo or you need to kill them stealthily, you can punch them (but time your movement and swing so they don’t get a bite in.  This works best if your Stamina stat has been raised up since your punches will do more damage).  You can also lure them into deep pits and just leave them stranded in there!  (This works great in the Borderlands, using the river that’s right before the entryway full of stalkers).</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TH>Sentinel<BR><IMG SRC="Sentinel.gif"></TH>
	<TD><A NAME="sentinel">They’re</A> also pretty sneaky, and quiet too.   Fortunately they’re pretty slow.  You can even sneak up behind them!  The best way to take them out is to charge them with the assault gun - if you get in close, you’re more likely to hit, and as long as you keep knocking them back with bullets, they won’t be able to get a shot off.  Explosive grenades also work well, especially against large groups of them (like the ones that come out of the ceiling in the Programmer’s Keep).  They tend to come out of little holes, so if you’re an ace shot with a grenade, you can lob one in with them and blow them right out.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TH>Reaver<BR><IMG SRC="Reaver.gif"></TH>
	<TD><A NAME="reaver">Extremely</A> fast, wily, good shots, and expert with a blade.  Fortunately, they’re not too sturdy.  A good, steady stream of flamethrower fire will take them out quickly.    They are expert ambushers, so watch your back.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TH>Templar<BR><IMG SRC="Templar.gif"></TH>
	<TD><A NAME="templar">They</A> obey alarms.  In fact, you can even talk to them under normal circumstances!  If you set them off though, watch out- they have Maulers (which they only fire in Scatter mode, thankfully), and if you get too close, they also have a nasty claw attack!   The flamethrower works nicely, or for longer ranges, try to lob grenades around their feet.  They tend to hang out in tight places like ledges, walkways, and balconies, so grenades can be pretty effective.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TH>Crusader<BR><IMG SRC="Crusader.gif"></TH>
	<TD><A NAME="crusader">Big,</A> clunky, and not subtle at all.  If you see one at long range, watch out - three missiles will be headed your way.  Get behind cover until the brute gets closer.  They use flamethrowers when they get close in. TIP: your environmental suits will protect you from flames!  Pop one on, and as long as you stick close, the Crusaders can’t harm you.  Then you can dispatch them with your own flamethrower.  If you want to take one out at long range, you can try shots with the grenade launcher.  Sometimes if you aim just right, the grenade will bounce around between their legs or on their heads before exploding!  When a Crusader dies, stand back - the resulting explosion can damage you.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TH>Inquisitor<BR><IMG SRC="Inquistr.gif"></TH>
	<TD><A NAME="inquisitor">Be</A> afraid, be very afraid. Sometimes, if you can get way above them, they can’t get to you (like in the Lab), but for the most part there’s nowhere to hide.  Long range attacks consist of homing grenades (ow).  At medium range they’ll just shoot you with a big gun.  And at short range, you can even get crushed underfoot.    The secret:  Torpedo mode on the Mauler.  A dead center hit will take one of these brutes out in one shot!  All you have to do is get that shot off before you get pulped. </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TH>Programmer<BR><IMG SRC="Programr.gif"></TH>
	<TD><A NAME="programmer">The</A> first real boss.  His Sigil blasts can mess you up.  Watch the shadow on the ground to see where the blasts will hit, and stay away from them.  If you can stun him, he won’t be able to get a shot off (the Incindiary grenades and the Assault gun are excellent ways to do this).  You may need to lure him into the flames if you use Incindiaries.  Hit him hard, and run like hell if he’s going to fire off a Sigil blast.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TH>Bishop<BR><IMG SRC="Bishop.gif"></TH>
	<TD><A NAME="bishop">A</A> tough dude.  Even after you kill his body, a Specter pops out that you have to dispatch also.  To destroy his body, use incendiary grenades or the Mauler.  Then, you’ll have to use the Sigil to destroy his Specter.  Make sure your blasts hit him - it’s easy for them to get caught on a wall,  fire too low, etc.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TH>Oracle<BR><IMG SRC="Oracle.gif"></TH>
	<TD><A NAME="oracle">This</A> is pretty much an all or nothing fight.  Things go much easier if you kill the guards before pissing off the Oracle (use poison arrows).  Then,  just talk to the Oracle instead of wasting bullets on him - you can provoke him (or rather, his specter) to come out and "play".  Note that you can’t hit his Specter until it comes down to eat you, even though it looks like you can hit it while it’s up near the skylight.   Also, watch out behind you - it’s first move is to teleport to the back of the room. Use the Sigil and fire as fast as you can - with any luck, you’ll take it out before it can take you.  Keep a spare Surgery kit handy (and a spare finger handy to activate it with the H key).</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TH>Macil<BR><IMG SRC="Macil.gif"><BR></TH>
	<TD><A NAME="macil">Don’t</A> kill Macil unless Blackbird (or the Oracle if you didn’t kill him) tells you to.  Macil is the one who tells you how to get to Richter, and without Richter you can’t get into the Factory.  If you kill the Oracle first, you’ll have three Sigil pieces, making it much easier to take out Macil’s specter.  Bring plenty of health, and make sure your shots are hitting him, even if you have to get in close (the Sigil-3 shotgun blast is deadly if all the shots hit).</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TH>The Loremaster</TH>
	<TD><A NAME="loremaster">Damn</A> this guy’s annoying.  Make sure you don’t open up his cage until you have cleared out the Inquisitors.  His "chain" attack can really mess you up, simply by dragging you off a high ledge.  Use the Strafe keys (lateral moves) to dodge the chains (dodge behind a wall if you can).    You might be able to lure him into an Incendiary blaze.  Otherwise, just be patient and hit him with ranged weapons like grenades, missiles, and the Mauler.  And, of course, keep your Sigil handy for when his Specter comes out.  If you find that you just don’t have enough health or ammo, don’t forget that you can leave and come back later!  You may want to search the factory for supplies you may have missed (the Forge area is full of goodies if you can get to it).  And of course, you can always do the sneaky tactic of saving your game every time you make some headway while battling him (though some might call that cheating).</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TH>The Entity</TH>
	<TD><A NAME="entity">Like</A> any Specter, the Entity can only be damaged by the Sigil.  Practice those lateral dodges (use the strafe key), keep moving, and make sure your Sigil blasts hit.  You may need to adjust your firing angle (use the [PgUp] and [PgDn] keys).  As long as you don’t get hit you should be fine (well, duh).  The entity breaks up into three little sub entities after a while, and yes you have to kill all three to finish the game.  The little ones are much slower and wimpier though, so just keep at it and don’t give up hope.</TD>
