There are four switches and a floor trigger on the level, plus no less than 14 one-way teleporters in the Proving Grounds!  Don稚 worry, this walk through will get you through the entire Proving Grounds in one fell swoop (although you値l have to take the enemies out on your own).  All compass readings are relative to the map.   Ready?
<P>

<B>The South:</B>
<P>
You start facing a wall - two lifts sit in the left and right corners.  Take the left lift down.  You値l be outside now.  Head to your left, towards the big square lift, and take it up.  Walk toward the striped gate poles - they値l open automatically(1).
<P>
Go through the door- you値l enter a room with Crusaders in holding pens.  Kill them and take the lift down in the middle of the room (2).  There痴 a switch down there.  Throw the switch, then exit the room through the door to the North.   Go down the curving stairs, then turn left and take the lift down.  Turn right, drop off the ledge, and head for the door on the corner of the big building (3).
<P>
<B>The West Side:</B>
<P>
Once inside, take the lift on your right all the way up, then turn right and go through the door (don稚 worry, you値l get the loot in a minute).  Then go through the door on your left into the little room (4).  Throw the switch in there, then grab the loot and go back to the big lift.  Take it down, turn right, and go down the narrow hall towards the teleporter (5).
<P>
Hop into the teleporter- it will put you outside on a big pedestal.  Carefully turn until you see a translucent wall.  Jump across and grab the loot (6).  Then drop down, turn right, and watch for a doorway on your right just before the end of the building.  Go in and take the curving stairs up into a watery area.  Take the teleporter at the back (7).  It will put you back near the start.
<P>
You値l be facing an inaccesible "Switchway".  Turn right, drop down off the ledge, then take the lift on your left (it goes up through a shaft).  Turn right and take the teleporter (8).  This puts you in the "switchway" (8b)-  throw the switch, then take the other teleporter (9).  
<P>
<B>The East Side:</B>
<P>
Now go through the gate, and take the lift down (on your left).  Turn right and follow the wall until you get to three teleporters.  Take the closest one (10).  You値l see a switch in a tiny room - throw it, then teleport again by backing up.   You値l be indoors (10b).  Walk forward, then turn left and when you get to a lift, take it down and to the left.  Then go straight ahead and take the little lift/stairs down, then go out the door on your right. (11).  Turn right and head towards the teleporters again.
<P>
Now take the middle teleporter (12).  Throw the switch,  then teleport again.  You値l be indoors, facing out(12b).  Walk out, then turn left and go through the funky tunnel.  Then turn left, and take the weird looking lift (on your left) down.    Walk until you see a teleporter on your left (13).  Take it.
<P>
<B>The Loot Room:</B>
<P>
You値l arrive in a room, facing a lift (13b).  Take the lift down, turn right, and follow the water to stairs.  Take the stairs up, then head through the left hall (it stairsteps down).  Turn left and look for a tiny black door.  Go through the door and into the teleporter (14).
<P>
You値l be in a switchway again (14b).  Throw the switch and take the teleporter (15).  You値l come out on the third teleporter (16)- carefully turn around and go through the open doorway- grab the loot!
<P>
<B>Leaving the Proving Grounds:</B>
<P>
Now, hit the teleporter (16) as you exit the loot room,  and you値l be in a tiny room with a lift door.    Be careful - sometimes, an Inquisitor can get stuck in this room via the teleporter!   Open the door, go straight, and take the lift down to the right.  Go down the three steps, then turn left and go up the big staircase.   You値l see a familiar teleporter on your right (13).  Go in to get back to the top of the map (13b).  
<P>
Now just go down the lift and straight ahead to exit the Proving Grounds (17).  Prepare to meet the Loremaster!
